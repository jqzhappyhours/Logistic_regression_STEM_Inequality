# Dismantling Inequality in STEM
This project explores demographic factors that 
influence the likelihood of having a 
degree and working in a STEM career. 
Data source: 2013 American Community Survey

# Steps of project
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Modeling 
- Conlusions

# Data Cleaning
- Recode place of birth code with state name
- Recode sex variable
- Recode race code with race name
- Create STEM degree and STEM occupation variables

# Exploratary Data Analysis
- There is interaction between gender and age in influencing the response variables
- States like California tend to produce more individuals in STEM
- Asian Americans w/ a STEM degree are mostly likely to work in STEM

# Modeling
- Use statsmodel package to fit logistic regression on the data
- Compute odds ratio for each independent variable. Odds are defined as the ratio of the probability of success and the probability of failure. 

# Conclusions
-  Gender gap is closing in schools but not in careers. Recommmendation: invest in university recruiting programs that support women 
-  Gender gap is more relevant among mid-career women. Recommendation: target mid-career women and provide technical training 
-  Race gap predominantly affects Black and Latino populations. Recommendation: expand partnership with minority-serving institutions such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
-  Place of birth influences the chance of having a STEM career. Recommendation: leverage remote work to acquire talents from non-traditional regions.
